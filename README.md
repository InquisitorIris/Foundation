# Foundation
This repository documents my 35-day coding challenge aimed at establishing a strong foundation in core programming concepts across three essential languages: Java, C, and Python.

- To run a Python file:
  ```
  python3 <file-name>.py
  ```
- To run a C file:
  ```
  gcc <file-name>.c -o <file-name>
  ./<file-name>
  ```
- To run a Python file:
  ```
  javac <file-name>.java
  java <file-name>
  ```
